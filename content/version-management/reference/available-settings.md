Generally, you are allowed to edit all of the zone-level configurations except for the following:

- DNS
- Traffic (Load Balancing, Waiting Room, Health Checks, and more)
- Zero Trust and Access policies
- SSL certifications (though you can test these with a separate [staging certificates](/ssl/edge-certificates/staging-environment/) feature)
